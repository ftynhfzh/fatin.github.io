  <h2>Unforgettable Experience</h2>
  <p>Year: 2012</p>
  <p>My family and I had the chance to take a vacation to China when I was eight years old. It was rather exciting for me to fly to China for the first time. When my family and I first arrived in China, we took a tour of Beijing and observed its distinctive architecture and culture. I also had the opportunity to visit Disney Wonderland, and words cannot express how much pleasure it was to play there. One day, I wish to travel to China once more.</p>
